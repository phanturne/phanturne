# Hey there, I'm Kevin üëã

Software Engineer at Peraton, currently doing my master's at Georgia Tech (which gives me way too many excuses to dive deeper into AI research).

Right now I'm building Metadachi, an AI platform that lets you chat with your documents and organize them into shareable notebooks. Started it because I was drowning in saved articles, PDFs, and notes scattered everywhere. Always adding new features and enhancing it, which honestly keeps things interesting: https://www.metadachi.com

I love the problem-solving aspect of engineering, whether that's mentoring newer devs, untangling some gnarly integration issue, or figuring out why my personal projects work perfectly until the moment I demo them to someone else. There's something satisfying about making complex things actually useful.

When I'm not debugging code (or my life choices), I'm probably reading about whatever AI development just dropped, watching K-dramas, or mentally refactoring code while exercising.

Always happy to chat about interesting projects, the latest in AI/ML, or really anything that gets you thinking differently. Drop me a line if you're working on something cool or just want to geek out about tech!
